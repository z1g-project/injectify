To add to an existing React, Dreamland, Next, etc project you can do it via downloading the npm package and adding it to your site via backend or using something like vite.

```bash
npm i @z1g-project/injectify
```

if your statically hosting this simply build this repository and add it to your site or use [`unpkg`](https://unpkg.com/@z1g-project/injectify@0.5.5-prev/dist/bundle.js) to add it.

### Setting up Plugins

Plugins should be saved to a localstorage item or you can modify the configuration to use something like `FilerFS` to access the plugins. Refer to our [documentation](/docs/readme.md) to learn how to configure your config file.
